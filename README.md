# Final Project: DSA Capstone Project
This repository contains my final project submissions for the Data anaylsis course led by Incubator Hub Digital Skills Africa. Although two projects were required, I completed three and have selected [Project 1] and [Project 2] for marking.

## Project Overview:
This project aims to solidify my knowledge and confirm my understanding of Data analysis concepts taught throughout the course. By implementing these projects, I demonstrate my ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems.

## Acknowledgments:
I'd like to extend my gratitude to the facilitators and teachers who helped me understand every concept, providing valuable guidance and support throughout the course.
